## Description:
- This fitness app was designed to inspire users to try new exercises and keep track of the exercises that work for them. After creating a free account, the user will be able to look up exercises by the muscle they are targeting for the workout, save the exercises they like most, update them if needed, and delete the more entry level exercises as they gain experience.
